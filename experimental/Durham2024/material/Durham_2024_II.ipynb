Unfortunately, this is not quite the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cartier divisors on varieties\n",
    "On a *variety* $X$ we can define Cartier divisors to be given by a collection $(U_i, f_i)$ where $f_i \\in R(X)$ is a rational function and for any pairs $U_i \\cap U_j$ the quotient $f_i/f_j \\in \\mathcal O(U_i \\cap U_j)^*$.\n",
    "In theory, this spares us the detour to complete the monoid of effective Cartier divisors.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to get back a Cartier divisor from a line bundle $\\mathcal L$ we may construct a *rational section* $s$ of $\\mathcal L$: Start on one chart $U_0$ of a local trivialization of $\\mathcal L$ and extend the local algebraic section $e$ for this trivialization as a rational section to all of $X$. In the notation above, the associated Cartier divisor will then be given by the collection $(U_j, f_j/f_0)$. We denote it by $c_1(\\mathcal L)$. \n",
